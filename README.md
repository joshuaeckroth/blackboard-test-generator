blackboard-test-generator
=========================

Converts textual inputs of various formats into Blackboard-compatible
tests for import.

The benefits are the following:
- Blackboard test questions can be written in Notepad, or any other
  text editor, in a simple format.
- Since the tests are written in text, they can be saved on your
  computer and tracked in a version control system (such as git).
- Tests are more easily shared with colleagues and easily modified.

Presumably, the same tests can be converted to other work in other
learning systems, such as Moodle and Desire2Learn. (I have not
verified that they support test uploads.)
